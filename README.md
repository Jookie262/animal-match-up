    <b> A Task Performance in Mobile App that aims to develop a simple mobile game like memory game. </b>
</h4>

## **Description** 🔥
Develop a simple mobile game similar to Oliver Kocsis' Match Up. Create and use at least one (1) style. In this game, all cards are first laid face down on a surface and two (2) cards are flipped face up over each turn. The object of the game is to turn over pairs of matching cards. The game ends when the
last pair has been picked up.

## **Scoring** 💯
The scoring system in the game is straightforward: correctly guessing a pair awards an additional 10 points, while an incorrect guess results in a deduction of 5 points.
| Correct | Wrong |
| :---:   | :---: | 
| + 10 points | -5 points |
